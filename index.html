            <h1>Particle Life</h1>
            <p>Particle Life is an interactive 3D simulation built with Three.js, where simple rules and a dynamic force matrix bring particles to life. Watch as countless particles interact, attract, and repel to form mesmerizing, evolving structures that seem almost alive. Every movement emerges naturally from basic principles, creating a digital ecosystem where patterns grow, shift, and self-organize. Explore the beauty of emergent behavior in a universe governed by simplicity and physics.</p>
